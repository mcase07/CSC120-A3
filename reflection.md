- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I like that as a programmer, I have more control over the exact thing that Java will do/ how it will act. Of course, this in turn makes it really finicky if I do something slightly awry. I'm definitely starting to understand the benefits of Java as an object-oriented language.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Overall, computers are really dumb! This was evident in Python and even more so in Java; I think having to communicate with a computer in an object-oriented way really highlights how exact and specific you need to be in order to get things to behave in exactly the way you want them to.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Definitely working with other worked! I was able to figure out a lot of my problems without really even needing help from TAs if I was working alongside someone else. I'm still having a hard time understanding the official Java documentation and I've found that when I have questions about how things work, I understand a lot better what I need to do when I'm able to look at an example.
